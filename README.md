This projectâ€™s main goal is to develop and train a natural language processing model to be able to capture human emotion through written text. The emotions that will be captured by the model will depend on 
the nature of the dataset and what the features recorded are; in our case our model will be trained on a collection of English twitter messages that are annotated with its corresponding predominant emotion.

## The Dataset:
The dataset includes collections of twitter posts written in English and annotated by their predominant emotions. Those emotions are classified as:
Sadness, Joy, Love, anger, fear and surprise each assigned a number from 0 to 5 respectively. The dataset is mildly unbalanced with some emotions like sadness (121,187) and joy (141,067) 
appearing more frequently than others like love (34,554) and anger (57,317). The overall shape of the dataset is 3 columns id, text and label and 416,810 instances. Emotions (kaggle.com)
